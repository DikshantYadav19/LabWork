	The interior of the chapel at St John's College, Cambridge. Constructed between 1866 and 1869 to replace a smaller chapel which dated 		back to the 13th century, this chapel was designed by George Gilbert Scott in a style similar to that of Exeter College, Oxford. It is 		home to the Choir of St John's College, which has sung daily services since the 1670s.
